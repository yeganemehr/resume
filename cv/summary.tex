\cvsection{The Pragmatist}

\begin{cvparagraph}

Back-end development keeps me energized! Whether it’s wielding the power of PHP (my go-to language!) or exploring the possibilities of GoLang, I’m always learning and pushing boundaries. Add DevOps and Linux management to the mix, and I’m in my happy place, ensuring smooth deployments and a well-oiled infrastructure.

However, I don’t shy away from the front-end! My skills in frameworks like Vue.js and React allow me to build user-friendly interfaces that complement the back-end seamlessly. Data management is another area where I excel, allowing me to create well-organized and efficient applications.

Leadership and problem-solving are at the core of my approach. Leading a team to launch JeyServer.com (check it out!) further honed these abilities.

If you’re looking for a versatile developer who excels in back-end development, DevOps, and can contribute to the front-end, let’s connect!
